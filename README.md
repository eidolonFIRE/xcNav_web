# Run lint:
`npm run lint`

# Compile:
`npx webpack`

Everything gets compiled into `./dist` directory.
All required assets are also copied there.

Default compilation mode is `development` which will
also make nearly all the webpack resources available
in browser debug window. This config should be changed
for production web hosting.
